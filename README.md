## Problem to solve

In a .adoc file (Asciidoc document), I can use `:toc:` to generate a Table Of Cotents (TOC).

I can convert a .adoc file into .md (Markdown) file using the `readmeconv.sh` script.

However, the `readmeconv.sh` does not generate a .md file with "TOC".

I want a .md with TOC.

## Solution

### Approach 2

Jump the current!

## Description

Let it be.
